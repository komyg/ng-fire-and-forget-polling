# Angular Fire and Forget Polling

This is the code for the tutorial: https://dev.to/komyg/angular-fire-and-forget-polling-with-ngrx-rxjs-and-unit-tests-3ab5. In it I would like ot show you how you can poll a service using Observables (RxJS) and the NgRx Store and Effects. It assumes that you have a basic knowledge of Angular, Typescript, NgRx and RxJS.

## Available Scripts

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
